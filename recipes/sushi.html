    <h1>Sushi</h1>
    <a class="back" href="../index.html">Back to Main Page</a>
        <p">Sushi is a great group project when serving 2+ people. The time it takes to make can be fun and interactive, and after you all have a tasty treat to enjoy!</p>
            <img src="../images/Sushi1.jpg">
        <p">I’ll be very honest and say that there’s definitely a reason why chefs spend a decade learning how to perfect sushi rice or cut raw fish like a boss, because it does make a difference.</p>
        <p">Homemade sushi will never be at the level of sushi from the top sushi restaurants in NYC, but here’s where homemade sushi wins:</p>
        <p">You get to gorge yourself on a sushi FEAST for like $20, whereas a similar amount of sushi at a restaurant would cost a couple hundred. Soooooo worth it, if you ask me.</p>
        <p>And you know what else? Sushi is really fun to make at home.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Seaweed <strong>specific for sushi-making</strong></li>
                <li>Prepared sushi rice</li>
                <li>Salmon</li>
                <li>Avocado</li>
                <li>Cream Cheese</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <p>Spread the seaweed with a layer of prepared sushi rice, and flatten gently with a rice paddle.</p>

            <h3>How to cut raw fish for sushi</h3>
                 <p>Here is how I cut salmon for my sushi rolls. First, cut straight down through the filet, then cut that piece in half through the center so you have a small strip.</p>
                    <img src="../images/Sushi3.jpg">
                <p>Place your desired ingredients onto the rice.</p>
                    <img src="../images/Sushi4.jpg">
                <p>Roll it up tightly, using a bamboo mat. It’s a specific kitchen item, but you can get a decent one for less than $2 on Amazon, so I think it’s worth having.</p>

                <p>If you don’t have one, you can sort of use parchment paper or plastic wrap, but you won’t be able to wrap it as tightly, so buy one if you plan to make sushi regularly.</p>
                    <img src="../images/Sushi5.jpg">
                <p>Then use a sharp knife to cut the sushi roll into pieces. I don’t find it particularly better to use a serrated knife. Just make sure to use a sharp one!</p>

            <h3>What to serve with your sushi?</h3>
                <p>Now you’re ready to eat the rolls with some soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi, as desired!</p>
