    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Make burgers your way and have them come out flawless every time with what I consider to be the Best Hamburger Patty Recipe, in my humble opinion.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">It’s a classic all-American recipe for mouthwatering burgers that can be cooked on the grill, on the stovetop, as thick 1/3 pound patties, or as ultra-thin griddle patties.</p>
  
    <h2 style="margin-left: 40px">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px">
        <li><strong>Ground chuck</strong> – <em>We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest burgers.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs</strong> – <em>The best binders for juicy hamburgers. (Could be gluten-free!)</em></li>
        <li><strong>Worcestershire sauce</strong> – <em>Adds a deep beefy, smoky flavor.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong> – <em>To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong> – <em>To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong> – <em>The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.</em></li>
        <li>Seasonings: Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices of choice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">It’s helpful to save prep time and add lots of flavor to your patties by adding dried spices rather than fresh herbs to the hamburger mix. For instance, you can incorporate red pepper flakes for a spicier burger, a bit of cumin and chili powder for a Southwestern-inspired bite, or parsley and dill to create a Mediterranean taste.</p>
    
    <h2 style="margin-left: 40px">How to Make The Perfect Burger Every Time</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">It seriously only takes mere minutes to make restaurant-quality hamburgers from scratch. Prep your workspace and ingredients before getting started and you’ll be whipping out hot plates from your home kitchen (or backyard) in no time!</p>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 40px">Here’s how…</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong>First</strong>, set out a <strong>large mixing bowl</strong> and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices.</p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px"><li>Use your hands to thoroughly combine until the mixture is very smooth.</li></ul>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px"><stong>Next</stong>, press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties. Like so:</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Set out a baking sheet, lined with wax paper or foil, to hold the patties. One at a time, gather the patty mix and press firmly into patties of your desired thickness. You typically want hamburger patties to be slightly larger than the buns they’ll be served on since they’ll shrink a bit in the cooking process.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Place the formed patties on the baking sheet. With thick patties, press a dent in the center of each patty, so they don’t puff up while cooking.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px">You can stack the patties with sheets of wax paper between layers if needed.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Then, preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 350-400 degrees F.</p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px"><li>I love using a cast-iron skillet for getting that drool-worthy caramelized sear on the burgers.</li></ul>
    
    <h2 style="margin-left: 40px">Best Burger Recipe Continued</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong>For thick patties:</strong> Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side for a medium burger.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong>For thin patties:</strong> Cook on the griddle for 2 minutes per side.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Ideally, you only want to flip your burgers once or twice during cooking.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Homemade cooked hamburger patties will keep well tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, or in an airtight container, in the fridge for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>
